# `za6_moveit_config` package

This package started out generated by `moveit_setup_assistant`, but
the launch files needed enough rework that it no longer seems
worthwhile to attempt to preserve the generated package.

## Run the demo

    ros2 launch za6_moveit_config demo.launch.py

The demo doesn't depend on any robot hardware, and is useful to check
URDFs and planning configuration


## Testing

Test with the demo:
```
colcon build && source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch za6_moveit_config demo.launch.py
```
